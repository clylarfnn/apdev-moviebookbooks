                According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. 
                Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. 
                The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible

                Sometimes, it is required to fit an image into a certain given dimension. 
                We can resize the image by specifying the width and height of an image. A common solution is to use the 
                max-width: 100%; and height: auto; so that large images do not exceed the width of their container. 
                The max-width and max-height properties of CSS works better, 
                but they are not supported in many browsers.
