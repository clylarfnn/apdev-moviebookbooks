        <h2>ABOUT MovieBookBooks</h2>
         <p>
             MovieBookBooks was founded in 1997 in Pangasinan as a movie rental business. MovieBookBooks founders Clyla Rafanan, Dani Solis, and Kyla Lacson came up with the idea of as movie rental service that allowed
             users to order movies from a website and have the DVDs be delivered via mail after hearing the complaints of friends who did not live
             near a video rental store. Since then, it has evolved into a move distribution company for Philippine cinemas. Since its transition from a movie rental business,
             MovieBookBooks has been the main distributor for local and foreign films for numerous cinemas in the country.
