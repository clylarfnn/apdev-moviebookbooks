          <h2>About MovieBookBooks</h2>
          <p>
               MovieBookBooks was founded in 1999 in Pangasinan as a movie rental business by three friends. MovieBookBooks founders Clyla Rafanan, Dani Solis, and Kyla Lacson came up with the idea of as movie rental service that allowed
               users to order movies from a website and have the DVDs be delivered via mail after hearing the complaints of friends who did not live
               near a video rental store. Since then, it has evolved into a move distribution company for Philippine cinemas. Since its transition from a movie rental business in 2007,
               MovieBookBooks has been the main distributor for local and foreign films for numerous cinemas in the country.

              store that caused Dani to pitch MovieBookBooks to her friends. When she's not working on business-related things, she can be seen
