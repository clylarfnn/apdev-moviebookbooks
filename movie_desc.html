                Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. 
                The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible

            <p class="description">Sometimes, it is required to fit an image into a certain given dimension. 
                We can resize the image by specifying the width and height of an image. A common solution is to use the 
                max-width: 100%; and height: auto; so that large images do not exceed the width of their container. 
                The max-width and max-height properties of CSS works better, 
                but they are not supported in many browsers.
